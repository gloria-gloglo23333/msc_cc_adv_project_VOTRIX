 ### Votrix
__Voice Matrix. 


#### The Votrix is a simple scenario game. Players need to use the leap motion as the main mode of operation, which is composed of four different scenes. We add four different animals in four different styles and themes of scenes, those animals will hit the ground like a pinball and make a sound, and each animal has different sound effects representing different instruments. Players need to control those animals-pinballs to find the final destination to enter the next level.
