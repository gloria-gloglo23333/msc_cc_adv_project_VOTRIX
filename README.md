 ### Votrix
__Voice Matrix. A magic matrix contain different aninals in different scences.


#### The Votrix is a simple scenario game. Players need to use the leap motion as the main mode of operation, which is composed of four different scenes. We add four different animals in four different styles and themes of scenes, those animals will hit the ground like a pinball and make a sound, and each animal has different sound effects representing different instruments. Players need to control those animals-pinballs to find the final destination to enter the next level.

### Concept

We aiming to help animals to make noise. Player can use the animal's body to make sounds by hitting the ground.

For example, the sheep’s intestines are used to make strings, the horn is used to make a trumpet, and there are also instruments associated with animal features, such as the zebra and the white tiger’s patterns, the piano keys and the animal’s ribs, the marimba.

### How to play?

When player first see the game, there will be cube rotating automaticlly. 4 sides of the cube have 4 different themes scences which contain different animal pineballs. THen the palyer just need to press the space key to enter the first scence to start. In each scene.\

The player will use leap motion to control the cube. The leap motion will recognise waving and grabbing movements to control the cube in each different scene. The goal of this game is to help the animal pineball reaching the target icon and entering next level. During the process of reaching the goal, the animals will make different pitched sounds by hitting different terrains.
